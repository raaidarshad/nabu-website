We live in different realities, shaped (in part) by the news we consume. The further apart our realities lie, the more likely we are to polarize. This nurtures distrust, stifles communication, and can lead to harmful outcomes. The pandemic, the state of our democracy, and persistent systemic issues are all exacerbated by innacurate stories, incomplete pictures, and even outright spin.

The problem **is not** that all news organizations are bad, or that journalists are a dishonest lot. Not at all. The problem is that bias is always present, and even those who strive to minimize it will, at times, have some creep in. Hell, there is some bias in picking what to even write about, what makes the front page, and what gets looked over (often referred to as editorial bias). This is why diversity is important! It helps remove, or at least account for, many types of bias. Some bias can be intentional, I'm sure, but a lot of it isn't. A lot of bias has to do with language, from intentional and inflammatory to unintentional and subtle. **Bias exists, and it colors how we see the news, and therefore the world.**

There is evidence to support that Americans find bias in the news to be a problem. ["74% of U.S. adults think that news organizations tend to favor one side when covering political and social issues".](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2016/07/07/trust-and-accuracy/)

There is also deteriorating confidence in news from profesional news outlets, well illustrated by more data from that same report.

The best remedy is arguably education: give people the tools and training to know what bias looks like, to know how to verify sources, to know what is credible. But even with education, we don't always have the time or energy to dig to the bottom of every story we come across. That's the whole point of the news, isn't it? People and organizations bring you relevant stories, so that you don't have to go searching for it or figure out what's going on.

So how do we deal with it? Many folks turn to one or two news sources that they trust, that they deem as credible. We think that diversifying your news sources is a great idea, which is why we made TODOANAME. It presents the results of our machine learning pipelines that group the latest articles by topic, automating the process of checking a variety of news website front pages. It has the added benefit of putting all the headlines next to each other for easy language comparison as well.

Beyond that, tools to help identify language-based bias are in the works. Sometimes it is difficult to identify language-based bias, but Natural Language Processing can help with that.

Bias is here to stay. The more context-aware and bias-aware we are with our news consumption, the more accurate a picture of reality we have. Nabu strives to help you do just that.
