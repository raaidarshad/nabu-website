We have a variety of ideas and features in various stages of development. Some are very experimental, while others are simply a matter of time.

### Sooner
- [x] Data pipelines to pull article content from sources
- [x] Machine learning pipelines to group together articles about the same topic
- [x] Latest articles, grouped by topic
- [x] Endpoint that accepts an article URL and returns a list of similar articles
- [x] A simplified page view using the similar-article endpoint
- [ ] A Twitter bot that uses the similar-article endpoint
- [ ] A Reddit bot that uses the similar-article endpoint
- [ ] A daily & weekly email roundup of topic-grouped articles

### Later
- [ ] Subjectivity/objectivity measurement
- [ ] Inflammatory language flag
- [ ] Topic summarization
- [ ] Identify spread of story within a topic
